       " Document(page_content='2. THE BACKGROUND OF THE OCT A TRACK MKII\\n112. THE BACKGROUND OF THE OCTATRACK MKII\\nWith the Octatrack we wanted to create a sampler that would regard recorded material not as inflexible \\nsounds, but rather as something highly malleable. This is one of the reasons why we made the Octatrack. \\nThe other one is because of the stage. The Octatrack on the other hand was designed to be a streamlined, \\nreliable and straightforward machine allowing live performers to really add something extra to their sets. It \\ncan act as a backing track machine, a second turntable, a source of experimental soundscapes or simply as \\nan instrument encouraging improvisation and fun. \\nDuring its seven year life span, the Octatrack quickly became one of the most widely used live performance \\nsamplers. An industry standard if there ever was one. It undoubtedly changed the way gear setups look like \\nand gave artists the power to perform live in the truest sense of the word.\\nNow we give you Octatrack MKII. Sharper, better, more robust. Enhanced on many levels to ensure world \\nclass sample mangling potential.\\nDurable back-lit buttons, upgraded silky smooth crossfader, ultra crisp OLED screen, precise hi-res encoders, \\nbalanced audio inputs, improved user interface. Octatrack MKII is a better version of itself. A classic reborn.\\nWe hope this instrument will keep you company for years to come and that you will find it both indispens -\\nable and liberating.\\nHave fun twisting those samples,\\n- The Elektron Team\\n2.1 SUGGESTED APPLICATIONS OF THE OCTATRACK MKII\\nThe flexibility of the Octatrack MKII makes it a very powerful device suited to a wide range of tasks. Here a \\nfew of them are presented.\\n2.1.1 LOOPER DEVICE\\nThe Octatrack MKII is ideal for DJ’s and live performers. You will be able to quickly sample a turntable or \\nother sound sources present on the stage and instantly play back and affect the recorded loop. Add pre-  \\nrecorded loops and sounds to samples captured in real-time to take your performance to a completely \\nnew level. The real-time timestretch will make sure everything stays in sync.\\n2.1.2 RADICAL SOUND PROCESSOR\\nThe combined power of the sampling engine, the sequencer and the FX blocks makes the Octatrack \\nMKII a very powerful audio mangler. This functionality is great when working in the studio and wanting to \\nobtain unique sounds and textures. \\n2.1.3 BACKING TRACK MACHINE\\nEach of the eight stereo tracks can stream gigabyte-large samples. Despite the large size of the samples \\nthey can still be subject to timestretch. Change the tempo of the Octatrack MKII and the backing track \\nsamples can be timestretched accordingly. On top of this you can treat the samples with the Octatrack \\nMKII effects and sequencer tricks.\\n2.1.4 LIVE SETUP HUB\\nThe two input pairs combined with the extensive audio routing possibilities allow the Octatrack MKII to \\nfunction as a mixer. Connect for example a Machinedrum and a Monomachine to the inputs and enjoy a \\ncomplete live setup with extreme possibilities.\\n2.1.5 REMIX TOOL\\nIt is easy to change the pitch of different sections of a vocal sample without changing the overall tempo \\nof the sample. Chopping up and rearranging samples and loops is extremely simple thanks to features \\nlike the LFO designer and slice points. The Octatrack MKII lets you break down audio content and re -\\nstructure it in new and interesting ways.\\n2.1.6 EFFECTS UNIT EXTRAORDINAIRE\\nChained FX blocks paired with automated real time sampling can warble and twist incoming audio in \\nways previously unachievable by a single machine. Two chains, each with 8 simultaneous effects, can be \\nactive at the same time.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='4. OVERVIEW OF THE OCT A TRACK MKII STRUCTURE\\n164. OVERVIEW OF THE OCTATRACK MKII STRUCTURE\\nThe Octatrack MKII is organized in a hierarchical way. The image below outlines the data structure of the \\nOctatrack MKII. \\nSet\\nAudio Pool\\nProject\\nBanks\\nPartsFlex Sample Slots\\nMachine Assignment Eﬀects AssignmentStatic Sample Slots\\nTrack Parameters ScenesPatternsArrangements\\n4.1 SETS\\nA set is the top level structure of the Octatrack MKII. It can contain a near unlimited amount of projects plus \\none audio pool. The number of samples in the audio pool, as well as the number of projects, are limited only \\nby the size of the Compact Flash card. The samples in the audio pool are available to all projects of the set. \\nSets are saved on the Compact Flash card. Since a set can contain many projects, some users might find \\nthat one set is all they need. For more information, please see “7. SETS” on page 26.\\n4.2 AUDIO POOL\\nEach set contains one audio pool which is stored on the Compact Flash card. The audio pool contains the \\nsamples that can be loaded to the Flex and Static sample slot lists of the projects of a set. For more infor -\\nmation, please see “7.2.1 ADDING CONTENT TO THE AUDIO POOL” on page 27.\\n4.3 PROJECTS\\nFor the Octatrack MKII to work as intended, a set needs to be mounted and a project needs to be loaded. \\nA project contains 16 banks, 8 arrangements, 8 track recorders and their recorder buffers, 128 sample slots \\ndedicated to Flex machines, 128 slots dedicated to Static machines, various project specific settings and \\nthe BPM setting for all the patterns of the project. \\nThe samples used to fill the Flex and Static sample slots are fetched from the audio pool of the set. The \\nsamples used by a project can also be collected and saved in the project folder. The command COLLECT \\nSAMPLES are used for this and makes a project more or less self contained. For the sake of sample or -\\nganization it is recommended to only store samples in the audio pool. For more information, please see “8. \\nPROJECTS” on page 28.  ', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4. OVERVIEW OF THE OCT A TRACK MKII STRUCTURE\\n174.4 FLEX AND STATIC SAMPLE SLOT LISTS\\nFor samples to be available to Flex and Static machines they first need to be loaded from the audio pool \\nto the Flex or Static sample slot lists. When samples are present in these lists they can be assigned to, \\nand thus processed by, Flex and Static machines assigned to the audio tracks of a pattern. Read how to \\nload audio pool samples to the sample slot lists in the section “8.3 LOADING SAMPLES TO THE SAMPLE \\nSLOTS” on page 29.  Read how to assign samples to a machine in the section “11.3 ASSIGNING FLEX \\nAND STATIC SAMPLES TO MACHINES” on page 56.\\n4.5 BANKS\\nEach project hosts 16 banks and each bank hosts 16 patterns and 4 parts. This makes a bank suited for \\nhosting a complete composition as the available patterns and parts allow a large number of song variations. \\nSwitching between banks is seamless, meaning playback won’t be halted or audio cut off. For more informa -\\ntion, please see “10.1 BANKS” on page 52.\\n4.6 PATTERNS\\nFor each bank 16 patterns are available, meaning 256 patterns are always at hand. A pattern consists of \\nsequencer data like trigs, parameter locks, track lengths and time signatures for the eight audio tracks and \\nthe eight MIDI tracks. For more information, please see “12. PATTERNS” on page 64.\\n4.7 PARTS\\n4 parts are available to each bank. A part contains machine assignments and their associated samples, \\ntrack parameter settings, FX assignments as well as 16 scenes. A pattern is always linked to a part. Chang -\\ning parts will let the active pattern control the new part. For more information, please see “10.2 PARTS” on \\npage 52.\\n4.8 SCENES\\nScenes are assigned to the scene A and scene B slots.

They are used to structure the playback of patterns. An arrange -\\nment is a great way to form a long sequence out of several patterns. For more information, please see “14. \\nTHE ARRANGER” on page 87.\\n4.10 TRACKS\\nAn Octatrack MKII pattern handles eight audio tracks and eight MIDI tracks. Each audio track can host a \\nmachine. Except for Neighbor machines, any machine type can be assigned to any of the eight audio tracks. \\nFor more information, please see “11. TRACKS” on page 55.\\n4.11 MACHINES\\nMachines are assigned to the eight audio tracks. Each machine fills a different purpose. Read more about \\nthe various machine types in “APPENDIX A: MACHINE REFERENCE” on page 117.  How machines are \\nassigned to tracks is covered in “11.2 ASSIGNING MACHINES TO TRACKS” on page 55.\\nFlex  machines process samples. They offer instant control over samples since Flex samples are loaded into \\nthe RAM memory of the Octatrack MKII. The samples available to Flex machines are located in the Flex \\nsample slot list, which can host 128 Flex samples. \\nStatic  machines process samples. The samples available to Static machines are located in the Static \\nsample slot list, which can host 128 Static samples streamed from the Compact Flash card. A single Static \\nsample can be as big as 2 gigabytes.\\nThru  machines are used to listen to the inputs of the Octatrack MKII. They can be used to affect incoming \\naudio with filtering and effects.\\nNeighbor  machines listen to the output of the preceding track. They can be used to build powerful effects \\nchains.\\nPickup  machines are ideal when wanting to use the Octatrack MKII as a looper device.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

OVERVIEW OF THE OCT A TRACK MKII STRUCTURE\\n184.12 HOW INFORMATION IS HANDLED\\nWhen working within a project there is no need to save as all changes are automatically cached on card. \\nChanges made to a project will be remembered even after the machine has been switched off. The only \\ntime an operation needs to be carried out is before removing the Compact Flash card. The project should \\nthen be synced to the card. For more information about this operation, please see page 30.\\nThere exists a SAVE command for projects though. Once you are content with a project, it is wise to save \\nit. If you continue your work with the project, but are not satisfied with the results, you can then bring back \\nthe project to the previously saved state by performing a project RELOAD command. For more information, \\nplease see “8.4.1 PROJECT” on page 31.\\nNever turn off the Octatrack MKII while the <CARD STATUS> LED is blinking. It indicates data \\nis being written to the Compact Flash card and disrupting this process may corrupt data. \\nOnly when the <CARD STATUS> LED emits a dimmed green and steady light the Octatrack \\nMKII might be switched off.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

The physical location of the \\nknobs on the front panel correspond to the layout of the parameters on the screen. Turn DATA ENTRY  knob \\nA to adjust the upper left parameter, turn DATA ENTRY  knob B to adjust the middle parameter of the upper \\nrow and so on. If one of the slots in the parameter grid is blank, the corresponding DATA ENTRY  knob fills \\nno function in that particular menu.\\n5.2.1 QUICK PARAMETER EDITING\\nIf the DATA ENTRY  knob is pressed down while being turned parameters will be adjusted in increments \\nof 7. This makes it much quicker to sweep through a whole parameter range.\\n5.2.2 PARAMETER VALUE JUMP\\nKeeping [FUNC]  pressed while turning a parameter will make the parameter values jump to relevant posi -\\ntions. For parameters ranging from 0 to 127 either 0 or 127 will be selected. For parameters ranging from \\n-64 to 63 the values will jump between -64, 0 and +64. Other alternatives exist as well, the value of the \\nEcho Freeze Delay TIME parameter will for example be doubled for each increment. This is useful when \\nusing the effect as a repeater.\\n• You can also randomize the parameter settings on a specific TRACK PARAMETER page \\non a Synth track.

First connect it as described in section “3.5 CONNECTING THE UNIT” on page 15.\\n6.1 DEMO MODE\\nIn demo mode, the Octatrack MKII can play back a set of 16 demo patterns without needing to have a  \\nCompact Flash card inserted. Demo mode is a great way to get acquainted with the basics of the Octatrack \\nMKII. Note that you can not save any changes made to the sounds or patterns while in demo mode.\\n1. Make sure no Compact Flash card is inserted. Press and hold the [YES]  key and then switch on the  \\nOctatrack MKII. The screen shows that you are entering demo mode..\\n6.1.1 PLAYING THE DEMO PATTERNS\\nIn demo mode, 16 demo patterns (A01–A16) are available.\\n1. Press  [PLAY]  to listen to pattern A01.\\n2. Select pattern A02, which is the second demo pattern, by pressing [PTN]  + [TRIG]  key 2. Pattern A03 \\nis selected by pressing [PTN]  + [TRIG]  key 3 and so on.\\n3. Mute tracks by pressing [FUNC]  + the [TRACK]  key of the track you want to mute. Unmute by repeat -\\ning the procedure.\\n6.1.2 ADJUSTING PARAMETERS\\nEach track contains five TRACK PARAMETER pages. Here you find the parameters that affects the sam -\\nple of the track. The keys used to open the pages are located directly below the screen. \\n1. Make sure the pattern is still playing.\\n2. Press the [TRACK]  key of the track whose sample you wish to affect.\\n3. To change the pitch of the sample, press the [SRC]  key. The SRC page will open. The parameter \\nlabeled PTCH  changes the pitch of the sample. Turn DATA ENTRY  knob A to change the parameter \\nvalue.\\n4. Try out the rest of the TRACK PARAMETER menu parameters to experiment with the sound shaping \\npossibilities.\\n5. To reload the parameter settings to their original state, press [FUNC]  + [CUE] .\\n6.1.3 EXPERIMENTING WITH SCENES\\nScenes contain locked parameters. The crossfader is used to morph between the locked scene parame -\\nters. Scenes are covered in the section ”4.8 SCENES” on page 17.\\n1. Select any demo pattern. Set the crossfader to its rightmost position. This will fully activate the scene \\nassigned to scene slot B.\\n2. Hold [SCENE B]  and press a [TRIG]  key to assign a new scene to the scene slot. The already as -\\nsigned scene is indicated by a red [TRIG]  key. Experiment with assigning different scenes to the \\nscene slot and listen to how the sound of the pattern changes.\\n6.1.4 RECORDING A PATTERN USING GRID RECORDING\\nUse GRID RECORDING mode to input sample trigs to the sequencer. Sample trigs trig the machines and \\nsamples of the tracks. In depth information about this mode is found in section “12.3.1 GRID RECORDING \\nMODE” on page 65.\\n1. Press the [RECORD]  key to enter GRID RECORDING mode. The [RECORD]  key will light up, indicat -\\ning the mode is now active. \\n2. Select the track to which you want to input sample trigs by pressing the relevant [TRACK]  key. \\n3. Press a [TRIG]  key to enter a sample trig. Press the same [TRIG]  key again to remove the sample trig. \\nIf the pattern contains more than 16 steps, use the [PAGE] key to switch between the pattern pages.\\n4. To edit other tracks, change the active track by pressing the other [TRACK]  keys. \\n6.1.5 RECORDING A PATTERN USING LIVE RECORDING\\nThe LIVE RECORDING mode allows you to record sample trigs and parameter changes while the se -\\nquencer is running. In depth information about this mode is found in section ”12.3.2 LIVE RECORDING \\nMODE” on page 65.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

You can now record sample trigs manually by pressing the last 8 [TRIG]  keys. Pressing [TRIG]  key 9 \\nwill add a sample trig to track 1, [TRIG]  key 10 adds a sample trig to track 2 and so on. You will be able \\nto hear all recorded sample trigs the next time the pattern starts over. \\n6.1.6 USING PARAMETER LOCKS\\nA parameter lock allows individual parameter values for a trig. It is one of the most important Octatrack \\nMKII features. For more information, please see “12.5 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 67.\\n1. When in GRID RECORDING mode, hold a [TRIG]  key and then tweak a parameter. The screen graph -\\nics of the adjusted parameter will become inverted to indicate that the sample trig now is locked to the \\nvalue you have set. The [TRIG]  key for the sample trig will flash to indicate that a parameter is locked \\nfor that step.\\n2. To remove all locks for a sample trig, press the [TRIG]  key of the locked trig twice. You can also \\nremove single locks. Hold the [TRIG]  key while clicking the DATA ENTRY  knob corresponding to \\nthe locked parameter to do so. The inverted graphics will disappear, and the parameter lock is now \\nremoved.\\n6.2 MOUNTING A SET AND LOADING A PROJECT\\nA set needs to be mounted for the Octatrack MKII to be able to load projects and populate the Flex and \\nStatic sample slot lists with samples. The Compact Flash card that came shipped with your Octatrack MKII \\ncontains a set called “PRESETS”. This set contains a project also named “PRESETS”. \\nIf you are using an empty Compact Flash card a set needs to be created and mounted before you can start \\nprocessing samples.

The Octatrack MKII will re -\\nmember the settings of the active bank even after being switched off, but will discard them if a new set is \\nmounted or another project is loaded. Should you want to save the changes as a new project, use the SAVE \\nTO NEW  command, found in the PROJECT menu. If the Octatrack MKII boot and sense that no project is \\nactive a prompt appears saying “YOU ARE NOT WORKING IN ANY PROJECT. USE THE SAVE AS NEW \\nCOMMAND TO KEEP ANY CHANGES!”\\nBefore ejecting the Compact Flash card the active project should always be synced to the \\ncard, by using the SYNC TO CARD operation. Otherwise changes will be lost. For more infor -\\nmation, please see “8.4.1 PROJECT” on page 31.\\n8.1 PROJECTS AND RAM MEMORY\\nThe total amount of RAM memory available to a project is 85,5 MB. This memory is shared between the \\ntrack recorders and the samples loaded to the Flex sample slots. By default the Flex sample slots can be \\nfilled with 64 MB of samples while the reserved track recorder memory ensures that each track recorder \\nalways can sample 2.7 MB of stereo audio. But you can change the allocation of reserved track recorder \\nmemory and Flex RAM memory. Track recorder memory can be increased at the cost Flex RAM memo -\\nry. The opposite also applies, meaning Flex RAM memory can be increased at the cost of track recorder \\nmemory. The track recorders can also use Flex RAM when sampling. Read more on how to allocate RAM \\nmemory in section “8.6.5 MEMORY” on page 37.\\n8.2 LOADING AND CREATING A PROJECT\\nBefore loading a project, a set needs to be mounted.

Samples loaded to the 128 Flex sample slots are called Flex sam -\\nples. They are only available to Flex machines. Samples loaded to the 128 Static sample slots are called \\nStatic samples. They are only available to Static machines. The samples in the sample slot lists are accessi -\\nble by all Flex and Static machines of the project. Read more how to assign the samples of the sample slot \\nlists to Flex and Static machines in section “11.3 ASSIGNING FLEX AND STATIC SAMPLES TO MACHINES” \\non page 56.\\nTo load samples to the sample slots the audio pool must contain samples.

In \\nthis menu the distribution of Flex RAM and track recorder memory can be set. To the right a bar is shown \\nvisualizing the memory distribution. The dotted area in the top represents occupied Flex memory, the \\nblack area in the middle represents free RAM and the white area in the bottom represents reserved track \\nrecorder memory.\\nChanges made does not come into effect until exiting the menu. When doing so, a prompt will appear \\nasking you to confirm the changes. This is because the recorder buffers are cleared when changes are \\nmade and confirmed.\\nFLEX FORMAT  controls what bit depth samples will be in when loaded to the Flex sample slot list. \\nSamples loaded to the Static slot list are unaffected by this setting. Two settings exist.\\n• 24-BIT  will retain the bit depth of 24-bit samples when they are loaded. 16-bit samples will still be \\nin 16-bit.\\n• 16-BIT  will convert 24-bit samples to 16-bit samples when loaded, meaning samples will occupy \\nless Flex RAM memory at the cost of reduced bit depth.

This setting in combination with the RESERVE LENGTH  setting basically \\ndecides the size of the track recorder memory.\\n• R1...R1-R8  selects the track recorders that will be affected by the RESERVE LENGTH  setting. \\nTrack recorders outside the selected track recorder range will not have any track recorder memory \\nallocated, making it impossible for them to sample unless DYNAMIC RECORDERS  is set to YES. \\nThese track recorders will then use the Flex RAM memory when sampling.\\n• NONE  will add all track recorder memory to the Flex RAM memory, making the total amount of \\navailable RAM, which is 85.5 MB, consist of only Flex RAM. As no track recorder memory will be \\navailable to the track recorders, sampling will be not be possible unless DYNAMIC RECORDERS  \\nis set to YES. The track recorders will then utilize the available Flex RAM memory when sampling. \\nWhen NONE is selected the RESERVE LENGTH  setting will have no effect at all.\\nRESERVE LENGTH  makes it possible to reserve sample time to the track recorders chosen by the \\nRESERVE RECORDINGS setting.

       " Document(page_content='9. TRACK RECORDERS AND PICKUP MACHINES\\n449. TRACK RECORDERS AND PICKUP MACHINES\\nThere are two ways to sample with the Octatrack MKII. Either by using track recorder sampling, which can \\nbe performed manually or by using recorder trigs, or by using specialized machines called Pickup machines, \\nwhich essentially work like loopers. Read more about track recorder sampling in the section “9.2 TRACK \\nRECORDER SAMPLING METHODS” on page 47.  Pickup machine sampling is covered in section “9.3 \\nPICKUP MACHINE SAMPLING” on page 49.\\nWhen performing track recorder sampling or Pickup machine sampling, track recorders are always used. \\nEach project features eight track recorders, one for each track, and they can be set up to record audio from \\nthe external inputs, from the main and cue outputs, from the internal tracks and from various combinations \\nof these sources. Track recorders do not have to be assigned to the tracks as they always are available. \\nThe RECORDING SETUP menus, covered in section “9.1 RECORDING EDIT AND SETUP MENUS” on page \\n44., are used to control from which sources and in what way the track recorders should sample.\\nBy default the track recorder memory is used when sampling, meaning each track recorder can sample for \\nabout 16 seconds. The reserved track recorder memory can however be increased or decreased. It is even \\npossible for the track recorders to sample directly to the Flex RAM memory. Settings relating to RAM mem -\\nory distribution is found in the MEMORY menu, which is covered on page 39. Read more about the general \\nhandling of RAM memory in section “8.1 PROJECTS AND RAM MEMORY” on page 28.\\nSamples captured by the track recorders are stored in recorder buffers. The eight recorder buffers are \\nlocated in the Flex sample slot list. To play back a sample captured via track recorder sampling, the corre -\\nsponding recorder buffer needs to be assigned to a Flex machine of a track. Since track recorder sampling \\nis independent from playback, the same track can be used for both sampling and playback of the sample.  \\nIt is also possible to assign the same recorder buffer to several Flex machines of a pattern. Each Flex \\nmachine track can of course still contain individual settings and sequencer trigs. Read more about recorder \\nbuffers in section “9.2.3 PLAYBACK OF CAPTURED RECORDER SAMPLES” on page 48.  Playback of \\nrecorded Pickup machine samples works a bit differently. If a Pickup machine is assigned to a track, it will \\nbe hard-linked to both the track recorder and recorder buffer of that track. No recorder buffers thus need \\nto be assigned for Pickup machines to play back recorded samples. Samples captured by Pickup machines \\nare still stored in the recorder buffers though, making it possible to save and edit these recordings.\\nRecorder buffer content is not automatically saved. If a recorder buffer contains a sample and the corre -\\nsponding track recorder starts to sample, the original buffer sample will be overwritten by the new sample. \\nAlso, samples in the recorder buffers are not retained in memory after switching off the Octatrack MKII \\nor changing projects. If you want to keep recorder buffer samples they need to be saved to the Compact \\nFlash card. This operation can be performed in the RECORDING SETUP EDIT menu, accessed by press -\\ning [FUNC]  + [REC3] . Alternatively, saving can be done from within the audio editor. This is covered in the \\nsection “13.2.5 FILE” on page 86.\\nFor tutorials on how to sample,  please, see “17.1 TRACK RECORDER SAMPLING” on page \\n104.\\nCaptured samples can be saved either directly in the audio pool or in the project folder. The \\nsetting controlling this is found in the PERSONALIZE menu. For more information, please see \\n“8.5.4 PERSONALIZE” on page 33.\\nRecorded samples can immediately be time stretched or time compressed to match the BPM \\nof the Octatrack MKII. Note that TSTR in the SRC SETUP menu must be set to either AUTO, \\nNORM or BEAT for this to function. If set to AUTO, make sure time stretch is activated for the \\nrecorder buffer. That is done in the ATTRIBUTES menu of the audio editor. For more informa -\\ntion, please see “13.2.4 ATTRIBUTES” on page 84.\\nThe samples captured by the track recorders can be opened directly in the audio editor for \\nfurther editing.

The sampling process is restarted when press -\\ning [TRACK]  + [REC1/2/3] .\\n• ONE2  makes the recorder, once the sampling process is initiated either manually or by recorder \\ntrigs, sample according to the length set by RLEN . The sampling process can be stopped prema -\\nturely by pressing [TRACK]  + [REC1/2/3] .\\n• HOLD  makes the recorder, once the sampling process is initiated, sample for as long as the \\n[TRACK]  + [REC1/2/3]  keys are pressed and held, given they are not pressed longer than the time \\nframe of the RLEN  setting allows. The outcome of the sample depends on if manual sampling or \\nrecorder trigs are used. \\nSRC3 chooses which internal source should be recorded. The source selection also defines how \\nsample playback will work when a track recorder trig and a recorder buffer trig are placed on the \\nsame sequencer step. If SRC3 is set to - and a track recorder trig records the audio inputs, the sound \\nthe sample trig will play back will be the sound that at the same time is being captured by the recorder \\ntrig. All other SRC3 settings will in a similar scenario make the sample trig play back the sound record -\\ned by the previous trig.\\n• - makes the recorder disregard any internal sources when sampling. \\n• MAIN  makes the recorder sample the mix routed to the main outputs.\\n• CUE  makes the recorder sample the mix routed to the cue outputs.\\n• T1 - T8  makes the recorder sample the output of the selected audio track.\\nLOOP  sets whether the captured sample will loop or not when played.\\nIf a source is set to “-” and you try to sample from it, only silence will be recorded.\\n9.1.3 RECORDING SETUP 2 MENU\\nEnter RECORDING SETUP 2 menu by pressing [FUNC]  + [REC2] .\\nFIN applies a fade in when starting the recording.

The setting is only relevant \\nwhen a Pickup machine is assigned to the track. The INAB  setting, located in the RECORDING SETUP \\n1 page, decides which input or inputs that should be monitored. If different track recorders contain \\ndifferent  AB settings, the setting made for the track recorder of active track is the one that will dictate \\nthe current Pickup machine monitoring level. The monitor signal is routed to the active track, mean -\\ning any track effects will affect the signal. It will also be routed to the output destination of the active \\ntrack.

This \\nparameter has no effect on track recorders trigged by the sequencer. This parameter is a reflection of \\nthe QUANTIZED TRIG  setting available in the ATTRIBUTES menu found in the audio editor.

Perfect loops are then easy to capture. When manually trigging the loops, \\nuse QPL to ensure they are played in perfect sync with the Octatrack MKII pattern.\\n9.2.2 RECORDER TRIG SAMPLING\\nRecorder trigs allow an automated sampling process as each recorder trig initiates sampling. Recorder \\ntrigs can be placed on the sequencer while being in either the RECORDING SETUP menus or in the \\nTRACK TRIG EDIT menu. For more information, please see “12.10 TRACK TRIG EDIT MENU” on page \\n73. To be able to place recorder trigs on the sequencer GRID RECORDING mode must be active. \\nRecorder trigs are entered by pressing the [TRIG]  keys.\\nA recorder trig defaults to sampling from all three input sources, but the source selection can be \\nchanged for each recorder trig. When in the RECORDING SETUP 1 menu, the source a recorder trig \\nsamples from can be seen by pressing and holding the [TRIG]  key of the recorder trig. The activated \\nsources are indicated by inverted graphics in the screen and by lit [REC1/2/3]  keys.  \\nTo activate or deactivate a sampling source for a recorder trig, keep the [TRIG]  key of the recorder trig \\npressed while pressing either [REC1] , [REC2],  or [REC3] . Subsequent recorder trigs being placed on the \\nsequencer will default to the latest activated source selection.\\nRecorder trigs can be turned into one shot recorder trigs. They trig sampling only once, which can be \\nvery useful when for example sampling live and not wanting to have to remove a recorder trig once it has \\ninitiated sampling. One shot recorder trigs are entered by pressing [FUNC]  + [TRIG]  and are indicated \\nby yellow [TRIG]  keys. For more information, please see “12.4.5 ONE SHOT TRIGS” on page 66.\\nIf a recorder buffer contains a sample and the corresponding track recorder starts to sam -\\nple, the original buffer sample will be overwritten by the new sample.\\nWhen sampling using recorder trigs the captured sample will be assigned the same BPM \\nas the current BPM setting of the Octatrack MKII. In the ATTRIBUTES menu of the audio \\neditor the BPM assignment of the sample can be changed. For more information, please \\nsee “13.2.4 ATTRIBUTES” on page 84.\\n9.2.3 PLAYBACK OF CAPTURED RECORDER SAMPLES\\nEach track recorder samples to a dedicated recorder buffer. The eight recorder buffers are located in the \\nFlex sample slot list, directly above the first sample slot position. \\nA recorder buffer thus functions just like a Flex sample and needs, just like a regular Flex sample, to be \\nassigned to a Flex machine before it can be trigged by the sequencer. However, when sampling with a \\nPickup machine, no buffer needs to be assigned since Pickup machines are hard-linked to the track re -\\ncorders and recorder buffers. Read more how to assign samples to machines in section “11.3 ASSIGNING \\nFLEX AND STATIC SAMPLES TO MACHINES” on page 56.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='9. TRACK RECORDERS AND PICKUP MACHINES\\n49\\nRecorder buffer samples are not retained in memory after the Octatrack MKII has been \\nswitched off. If you want to keep them they need to be saved to the Compact Flash card. \\nThis is done either in the audio editor, described in the section ”13.2.5 FILE” on page \\n86. or in the RECORDING SETUP EDIT menu, which is accessed by pressing [FUNC] + \\n[REC3].\\nBefore starting to sample using the track recorder sampling methods, it is often a good \\nidea to first assign a recorder buffer to the Flex machine of a track. The recorder buffer \\nshould preferably correspond to the track recorder you are going to use when sampling. If \\nfor example track recorder 1 is used, recorder buffer 1 could be assigned to a Flex machine \\nassigned to track 1. When sampling with track recorder 1 you will then immediately be able \\nto play back the recorded sample.\\n9.3 PICKUP MACHINE SAMPLING\\nPickup machines offer a specialized way of sampling and are oriented towards building loops. By using Pick -\\nup machines it is possible to capture loops, add overdubs, repeat looped sections, add new loops and even \\nadjust the general Octatrack MKII BPM to the BPM of captured loops. Pickup machines can be controlled \\nwith for example MIDI foot controllers, making them very well suited for live manipulation of audio.\\nPickup machines are still dependent on track recorders and recorder buffers, but can be regarded as an \\nalternate way of controlling them. As soon as a Pickup machine is assigned to a track, it is hard-linked to the \\nboth the track recorder and the recorder buffer of that track. Pickup machine behavior is thus controlled by \\nthe settings available in the RECORDING SETUP menus. The source they will sample from is set there and \\nthe same goes for recording length, fade in/outs and so on. Since Pickup machines are linked to recorder \\nbuffers as well, no recorder buffer assignments need to be done for a Pickup machine to play back record -\\nings. Note that for a Pickup machine to be able to sample, the track it is assigned to needs to be active. \\nGiven Pickup machines are focused on loops, their playback works very differently compared to Flex and \\nStatic machines. Pickup machines are not possible to sequence, nor parameter lock. The screen graphics \\nfor the Pickup machines also differ a bit compared to other machines. Where the sample name is normally \\nshown, the playback position and loop length, expressed in sequencer steps, are shown instead. To the \\nright of the loop length, information about which trig mode that has been chosen for the Pickup machine is \\nshown. One block equals ONE, two blocks equal ONE2, a standing block equals HOLD.\\n9.3.1 MASTER AND SLAVE PICKUP MACHINES\\nThe first Pickup machine that records a loop acts as the master. The BPM of the Octatrack MKII will \\nautomatically change according to the calculated BPM of the recorded loop. If Pickup machines are \\nassigned to other tracks, the loops they record will be slave loops. The length of these loops can be de -\\npendent of the length of the master loop. If the LEN  parameter of a slave Pickup machine is set to X1, the \\nloop that machine will record will have the same length as the master loop. It will also force the slave loop \\nto be in phase with the master loop. If set to X2, the slave loop will be double the length of the master \\nloop. If playback of all Pickup machines is stopped, the first Pickup machine that records a new loop will \\nbe the new master. \\nThe master/slave relation is visualized by the track icons. Two pixels located at the top left side of the “P” \\nindicate a master Pickup machine. Two pixels to the bottom left indicate a slave Pickup machine.\\nIn the illustration above, the leftmost track icon depicts a master Pickup machine while the right icon \\nshows a slave Pickup machine.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

TRACK RECORDERS AND PICKUP MACHINES\\n509.3.2 CONTROLLING THE PICKUP MACHINES\\nTo suit a more looper oriented workflow, the function of the [REC1/2]  keys is altered for tracks contain -\\ning Pickup machines. They no longer correspond to the external inputs, but rather function as record \\nand play keys. In general [REC1]  controls the record function of the Pickup machine, while [REC2]  \\ncontrols the play function. However, how they work in more detail depends on the TRIG setting found \\nin RECORDING SETUP 1 menu. A detailed diagram of Pickup machine states is found in the end of this \\nchapter.\\nIf ONE is selected, recording of a new loop will begin when pressing [REC1] , given that the track is cur -\\nrently stopped. The loop length is decided by the RLEN  parameter of the RECORDING SETUP 1 menu. \\nIf [REC1]  is pressed again, while still recording, the recording will restart, just like it does when sampling \\nusing a track recorder whose TRIG  option is set to ONE. When the loop has been recorded the Pickup \\nmachine will automatically enter overdubbing mode, unless [REC2]  was pressed during sampling, in \\nwhich case it will start playing the loop without overdubbing. Toggle between overdubbing and replacing \\nusing the [REC1]  key. To stop overdubbing, or replacing, press [REC2] . This will not stop the playback of \\nthe loop, only the sampling process. Toggle between stop and play using [REC2] . To overdub again, just \\npress [REC1]  while the loop is playing.\\nONE2 works very similar to the ONE mode. The difference is that the loop length may be actively defined \\nby pressing [REC1]  or [REC2]  after sampling has started. If [REC1]  is pressed overdubbing begins, if \\n[REC2]  is pressed playback begins. If none of the keys are pressed, the loop length will be defined by \\nthe RLEN  setting and the Pickup machine will automatically start overdubbing when the set length has \\nbeen recorded. \\nWhen HOLD is selected, sampling is made by pressing and holding [REC1] . When the key is released, the \\nPickup machine will start playing the loop. To make overdubs, just press and hold [REC1]  again while the \\nloop is playing. Replacing is not possible in this mode, but you can achieve the same results by setting \\nthe GAIN parameter of the PICKUP MAIN menu to -INF, given OP, found in the same menu, is set to DUB.\\nThe Pickup machine track icons change depending on their current status.\\nThe various Pickup machine states are illustrated above. From left: stopped, playing, recording, overdub -\\nbing, replacing.\\nFor a step by step tutorial on how to sample with the Pickup machines, please see “17.1.4 \\nPICKUP MACHINE SAMPLING” on page 105.\\nUse a MIDI foot controller for hands-free operation of the Pickup machines.

Once the Static machine catches up the sample will be played back \\nfrom the correct start position. Parameter locking the STRT  parameter will however make the sample play \\nback exactly according to the locked position. Flex samples do not experience these limitations and will \\nalways play back from the correct position no matter how heavily modulated the STRT  parameter is.\\n11.2 ASSIGNING MACHINES TO TRACKS\\nMachines can be assigned to a track in either the QUICK ASSIGN or SRC SETUP menus.\\n11.2.1 ASSIGNING MACHINES IN THE QUICK ASSIGN MENU\\nOpen the QUICK ASSIGN menu by quickly double pressing the [TRACK]  key of the track you wish to \\nassign a machine to. \\nIf the track contained a Flex machine the Flex sample slot list will be opened.

If you wish to alter a pattern but keep the initial sample trig placements you will have to copy the pat -\\ntern to a new location and then use the copied pattern as the basis for the new pattern. A pattern contains:\\n• Sample trigs for the eight audio tracks.\\n• Note trigs for the eight MIDI tracks.\\n• Track recorder trigs for the eight track recorders.\\n• Trigless trigs for the eight audio tracks and the eight MIDI tracks.\\n• Swing trigs for the eight audio tracks and the eight MIDI tracks.\\n• Slide trigs for the eight audio tracks.\\n• One shot trigs for the eight audio tracks.\\n• Information about which pattern is linked to a part.\\n• Parameter locks.\\n• Conditional locks\\n• Sample locks.\\n• Length and time signature of the tracks.\\n12.1 TRIG INDICATIONS\\nDepending on if the [RECORD]  key is lit or not, the [TRIG]  keys will display different information when the \\nsequencer is playing.\\nIf the [RECORD]  key is unlit the eight rightmost [TRIG]  keys will indicate sample trigs being activated by \\nthe sequencer.

A lit red [RECORD]  key indicates GRID \\nRECORDING mode is active. Select the track to which you want to add trigs by pressing the relevant \\n[TRACK]  key. Place for example sample trigs on the sequencer by pressing the [TRIG]  keys. Sample \\ntrigs are indicated by red [TRIG]  keys. Several trig variants exist and they are covered in section “12.4 \\nTRIG TYPES” on page 66.\\nIf the pattern contains more than 16 steps, switch to the pattern page you want to edit by pressing the \\n[PAGE]  key. The active pattern page is being indicated by a fully lit <PAGE> LED.\\nPress [PLAY]  to listen to the sequence. You can input sample trigs when the sequencer is playing as well.\\n• You have the possibility to preview a specific trig. The preview includes any parameter \\nlocks you have placed on that trig.  \\n- Press [TRIG] + [YES] to preview an audio track trig on the MAIN outputs.  \\n- Press [TRIG] + [CUE] to preview an audio track trig on the CUE outputs.  \\n- Press [TRIG] + [YES] or [TRIG] + [CUE] to preview a MIDI track trig.\\n• All trigs of a track can be shifted forwards or backwards on the sequencer. While in \\nGRID RECORDING mode, hold down [FUNC] while pressing the [LEFT] or [RIGHT] \\narrow keys to perform the trig shift.\\n• For tracks configured to play slices or slots when receiving MIDI note data, holding a \\ntrig in GRID RECORDING mode while receiving a MIDI note locks the same slice/slot \\nthat is played to the held trig. For more information, please see “12.8 MIDI NOTE MAP -\\nPING FOR AUDIO TRACKS” on page 70.\\n12.3.2  LIVE RECORDING MODE\\nLIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the \\n[TRIG]  keys can be played in real time to input trigs. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real \\ntime. Trigs input in LIVE RECORDING mode will by default be quantized to full sequencer steps, hence \\nnot micro timed. This behavior can be changed in the PERSONALIZE menu. For more information, please \\nsee “8.5.4 PERSONALIZE” on page 33.\\nHold [RECORD]  while pressing [PLAY]  to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. The sequencer will start to \\nplay and the [RECORD]  key will start to flash. You can now enter sample trigs in real time by pressing \\n[TRIG]  keys 9-16. Pressing [TRIG]  key 9 will input a sample trig on track 1, pressing [TRIG]  key 10 will \\ninput a sample trig on track 2 and so on. When in TRACKS mode or CHROMATIC mode, trigless trigs, \\ninstead of sample trigs, can be recorded if [FUNC]  is held while pressing the [TRIG]  keys. This is useful if \\nyou, for instance, want to use the CHROMATIC mode to live record pitch changes to a sample, but don’t \\nwant the sample to restart on every pitch change. Read more about the TRACKS and CHROMATIC trig \\nmodes in the section “12.7 TRIG MODES” on page 68.\\nTurning a knob while in LIVE RECORDING mode will input parameter locks to the active track. The pa -\\nrameter locks will be input as lock trigs when no sample trigs are present. Sample trigs will be parameter \\nlocked accordingly.\\nTo erase trigs in real time, press and hold [NO]  + the [TRACK]  key of the track you wish to erase trigs \\nfrom. All trigs hit by the light of the running sequencer will be erased from the active track. The trigs of \\nmore than one track can be removed by pressing several [TRACK]  keys simultaneously. \\nTo remove only parameter locks in real time, press and hold [FUNC]  + [NO] . All trigs hit by the running \\nlight of the sequencer will be erased from the active track. Sample locks will however not be erased.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",

To exit LIVE \\nRECORDING mode and keep the sequencer playing the pattern, press [PLAY].\\n12.4 TRIG TYPES\\nA trig is a sequencer event that you can place when you want the sequencer to perform an action. The \\nOctatrack MKII sequencer accommodates a number of different trig types. Trigs can be entered while being \\nin GRID or LIVE RECORDING mode and are, depending on the type of trig, indicated by red, green or yellow \\n[TRIG]  keys colors.\\n12.4.1 SAMPLE TRIGS\\nSample trigs trig the machine of the track, making the sample assigned to the machine play. Enter by \\nsimply pressing a [TRIG]  key. Sample trigs are indicated by red [TRIG]  keys.\\n12.4.2 NOTE TRIGS\\nNote trigs trig notes on the MIDI tracks. Enter by simply pressing a [TRIG]  key. Note trigs are indicated \\nby red [TRIG]  keys.\\n12.4.3 LOCK TRIGS\\nLock trigs trigger parameter locks, but without triggering samples/notes. Lock trigs do not trig machines, \\nLFOs or FX envelopes. Enter them by pressing [FUNC]  + [TRIG] . \\nLock trigs are indicated by dim green [TRIG]  keys. Already existing sample trigs can be turned to lock \\ntrigs by pressing [TRIG]  + [NO]  twice. To turn a lock trig into a trigless trig, press [TRIG]  + [NO] . When \\npressing the [TRIG]  key of a lock trig, it will turn into a sample trig. Press the [TRIG]  key again to remove \\nthe sample trig altogether.\\nWhen in LIVE RECORDING mode and changing lockable parameters, lock trigs containing the locked \\nparameters is added automatically to the sequencer.\\n12.4.4 TRIGLESS TRIGS\\nTrigless trigs function similarly to lock trigs, but trig LFOs and FX envelopes. They can only be applied by \\nconverting sample trigs or lock trigs. \\nTrigless trigs are indicated by full-bright green [TRIG]  keys. An already existing sample trig can be turned \\nto a trigless trig by pressing [TRIG]  + [NO] . To turn a trigless trig into a lock trig, press [TRIG]  + [NO] . \\nWhen pressing the [TRIG]  key of a trigless trig, it will turn into a sample trig. Press the [TRIG]  key again \\nto remove the sample trig altogether.\\n12.4.5 ONE SHOT TRIGS\\nOne shot trigs trig a sample or a track recorder only once. They are especially useful when using the Oc -\\ntatrack MKII as a backing track machine, as they, for example, can trig very long Static samples without \\nretrigging them once the pattern loops. This trig type is also available to recorder trigs. One shot trigs are \\nnot available to MIDI tracks. \\nIf a track contains several one shot trigs, all one shot trigs of that track will be disarmed once one of \\nthe one shot trigs has been activated by the sequencer. This extends to the tracks of other patterns as \\nwell. If a one shot trig has been trigged on track 1 of pattern A01, any one shot trigs on the first track of \\npatterns A02-P16 will also be disarmed.\\nOne shot trigs are entered by pressing [FUNC]  + the [TRIG]  key of an existing sample trig. The [TRIG]  \\nkey will change from red to yellow, indicating the trig now is now a one shot trig. One shot trigs that have \\nbeen activated by the sequencer are indicated by alternating yellow and red [TRIG]  keys. Quickly press -\\ning [STOP]  + [STOP]  while the sequencer is stopped, power cycling the Octatrack MKII or changing \\nprojects will re-arm all one shot trigs. The [STOP]  + [STOP]  behavior can be disabled in the PERSONAL -\\nIZE menu. For more information, please see “8.5.4 PERSONALIZE” on page 33.\\nThere exists several ways of arming and disarming one shot trigs. While in GRID RECORDING mode and \\neither the RECORDING SETUP menus or the TRACK TRIG EDIT menu with REC TRIG chosen, is active, \\nall one shot recorder trigs of the active track will be re-armed when pressing [YES] . The text “ARM REC \\nTRK” will be visible. The one shot recorder trigs will keep re-arming for as long as the key is held. Note \\nthat one shot sample trigs will not be affected.

Read \\nmore about track recorder trigs in section “9. TRACK RECORDERS AND PICKUP MACHINES” on page \\n44.\\n12.5  PARAMETER LOCKS\\nParameter locks is a powerful feature that allows every trig to have its unique parameter values. All sample \\ntrigs of a track could, for example, have different pitch or volume settings. Parameter locks can be applied \\nto sample trigs, trigless trigs, lock trigs and one shot trigs. All parameter locks of a trig can either be re -\\nmoved by performing a TRIG LOCK CLEAR command, or by simply removing the trig and entering it again. \\nFor more information, please see “12.9.10 TRIG LOCK CLEAR” on page 73.\\nTo apply parameter locks in GRID RECORDING, first press [RECORD]  to activate GRID RECORDING mode. \\nPress and hold one or more [TRIG]  keys of previously placed trigs (note trig or a lock trig) where you want \\nto add parameter locks and then adjust the parameters you want to lock using the DATA ENTRY  knobs. The \\ngraphics in the screen will become inverted for the locked parameter and the locked parameter value will be \\ndisplayed. The [TRIG]  keys that contains the locked trigs will begin to flash rapidly, indicating the trigs now \\ncontains a parameter lock. Remove a single parameter lock by holding [TRIG]  + pressing the DATA ENTRY  \\nknob of the locked parameter. \\nTo apply parameter locks in LIVE RECORDING mode, turn a DATA ENTRY  knob to add parameter locks  \\nto the active track. The parameter will be locked accordingly and lock trigs will be placed on the  \\nsequencer steps.\\n12.6  SAMPLE LOCKS\\nEach sample trig of a track can play a different sample. To do this, open the SAMPLE LOCK menu by hold -\\ning down a [TRIG]  key and either pressing the [UP] /[DOWN]  keys or turning the LEVEL  knob.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 66}),\n",

Both Flex and Static \\nsamples can be sliced.\\nA slice is a section of a sample. A total of 64 slices can be placed out anywhere in a sample. Slices can \\nbe of different lengths and even overlap each other. Once a sample has been sliced, individual slices can \\nbe played back by using the [TRIG]  keys or the Octatrack MKII sequencer. \\nSlices does not need not be linked to samples, the default behavior is for them is instead to be linked \\nto sample slots. It is therefore possible to load the same sample to two separate sample slots and slice \\nthem in completely different ways. Slice point information will, unless linked to the sample by using the \\nsave commands of the FILE menu, be lost when assigning a new sample to the sample slot location the \\nsliced sample resides in.\\nThe SLIC  parameter, found in the SRC SETUP menu, needs to be set to ON for the sequencer to be \\nable to play back individual slices. The STRT  parameter of the SRC MAIN page then selects which slices \\nthat should be played. The selected slice will be played from its start point. Read more about how these \\nsettings work in “APPENDIX A: MACHINE REFERENCE” on page 117.\\nPressing [FUNC]  + [BANK]  or [YES]  opens the SLICE EDIT menu. Different options will appear, depend -\\ning on whether the SLICE EDIT menu is opened while a slice is highlighted or not.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

The slice grid can consist of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48 or 64 slices. After \\ncreating the slice grid a prompt will appear asking “ALIGN MARKERS TO ZERO-CROSSES?”. If [YES]  \\nis pressed the slices in the grid will be adjusted to the nearest zero amplitude crossings.

This menu \\ncan also be accessed by pressing [FUNC]  + [AED].\\nCREATE LINEAR LOCKS  will, given the active track contains a Flex or Static machine, automatically \\nset the SLIC  parameter in the SRC SETUP menu to ON and lock the STRT  parameter of sample trigs \\nalready present on the active track. The STRT  parameter of the first sample trig will be locked to SL1, \\nthe STRT  parameter of the second sample trig locked to SL2 and so on. The locked STRT  values are \\ndependent on the amount of slices in the sample. If only one slice exist all sample trigs will for example \\nbe locked to SL1. If SLIC  is turned off, the value of the STRT  locks will revert to approximations of the \\nslice start points:\\nSLIC  set to ON, STRT  set to SL1 = STRT 0 when SLIC  is set to OFF\\nSLIC  set to ON, STRT  set to SL2 = STRT 2 when SLIC  is set to OFF\\nSLIC  set to ON, STRT  set to SL3 = STRT 4 when SLIC  is set to OFF\\nSLIC  set to ON, STRT  set to SL4 = STRT 6 when SLIC  is set to OFF\\nNote that turning off SLIC  may change the structure of a sample completely.\\nCREATE RANDOM LOCKS  works just like the CREATE LINEAR LOCKS command, but randomizes \\nthe locked STRT parameters of the sample trigs.\\nCHANGE VIEW  changes the waveform visualization if a stereo sample is used. It works just like the \\nsame command found in the TRIM EDIT menu.\\nUse the waveform marker or press the [RIGHT]  or [LEFT]  arrow keys to navigate between the slices. \\nA slice needs to be active, which is indicated by inverted graphics, for slice start, loop and end points to \\nbe set. When a slice is active knob A sets the start point, knob B sets the loop point and knob C sets the \\nend point. When moving the start, loop or end points, their sample exact position will be shown at the \\nbottom of the screen.\\nDue to the nature of Compact Flash cards, Static sample slices might not be played back \\ncorrectly when modulating the STRT parameter with the crossfader or the track LFOs. \\nThe start point of the slices might then be off. This problem is avoided when using param -\\neter locks. Flex samples don’t have this problem because of them being stored in the RAM \\nmemory.\\nSTRT values exceeding the amount of slices will select the last slice.

Please note that this value is applied only when a sample is be -\\ning trigged. If the sample being edited is long, adjusting this parameter during playback of the sample \\nwill thus introduce no gain changes until it is retrigged.\\nLOOP MODE  controls the loop behavior of the sample. Three settings exist.\\n• OFF  disregards all set loop points. The sample or slice will not loop.\\n• ON  will loop a sample or sample slice containing a loop marker. Sample slices without loop points \\nwill not be looped. Read more about loop points in section “13.2.1 TRIM” on page 80.\\n• PINGPONG  makes the sample loop from the loop point to the end point, then play from the end \\npoint to the loop point. The sample will thus alternate between playing forwards and backwards.\\nIf the LOOP parameter in the FLEX/STATIC SRC SETUP menu is set to AUTO, different \\nloop settings can be applied to different samples used in a track.\\nTIMESTRETCH  sets whether timestretch should be applied to the sample or not. Different timestretch \\nalgorithms exist.\\n• OFF  does not apply timestretch to the sample.\\n• NORMAL  is an algorithm suitable for most material.\\n• BEAT  is a timestretch algorithm especially useful for rhythmic material.\\nIf the TSTR  parameter in the FLEX/STATIC SRC SETUP menu is set to AUTO, different \\ntimestretch settings can be applied to different samples used in a track.\\nORIGINAL TEMPO  displays the calculated BPM of the sample. If it is not correct, it can be changed \\nusing the LEVEL  knob. This setting will affect the sound of a timestretched sample. For correct results \\nit should be set to match the original BPM of the sample. Altering this setting will alter the  TRIM LEN \\n(BARS) and LOOP LEN (BARS)  settings. An arrow will appear next to the ORIGINAL TEMPO  setting, \\nindicating this setting has priority. If the sample being edited consists of an unknown amount of bars, \\nbut you know its BPM, it might be wise to use this setting as the prioritized one.\\nThe tempo discerning algorithm analyzes the sample filename for tempo figures, \\nchecking if the initial estimation is off by a factor 0.5 or 2.0. The ”normal” BPM range the \\nOctatrack MKII uses to make its initial BPM guess is 85 BPM-170 BPM. If you have loops \\nwith tempos outside this range, it might be a good idea to put the BPM value in the file -\\nname. Typically, a 70 BPM loop is initially loaded as 140 BPM loop, but if the number 70 \\nis found anywhere in the filename, the Octatrack MKII will use 70 BPM instead. \\nTRIM LEN (BARS ) shows the length of the sample in bars.

If the \\nsequencer is stopped, quickly pressing [STOP] + [STOP] will send an all notes off command, \\nresend CC parameter values as well as any program change values for all tracks to which a \\nMIDI channel has been assigned.\\nTwo pixels in the upper left corner of the screen indicates MIDI port activity. The left pixel \\nblinks when MIDI data is received, the right pixel blinks when MIDI data is being sent out.\\n15.1 ACCESSING THE MIDI SEQUENCER\\nAccess the MIDI mode by pressing the [MIDI]  key. The [MIDI]  key will light up, and the tracks will now re -\\nflect the MIDI tracks and the sequencer data that belongs to them.\\nUnder the name of the active part, the MIDI channel the active track sends out MIDI data to is visible. The \\ntrack icons to the left and right also indicate the assigned MIDI channels for each track. An “X” means the \\ntrack doesn’t send data to any MIDI channel. You select the MIDI channel on the NOTE SETUP page. For \\nmore information, please see “15.4.2 NOTE SETUP” on page 92.\\n15.2 HOW MIDI IS ROUTED\\nIf an audio track and a MIDI track share the same MIDI channel, the MIDI track will block the audio track \\nfrom sending out data while the audio track will block the MIDI track from receiving data. In the PROJECT \\nmenu you can see which MIDI channels are assigned to which audio tracks. For more information please \\nsee “8.7 MIDI” on page 39.\\nIn MIDI mode, notes received on the auto channel or the MIDI channel of the active track are mixed with the \\nMIDI data sent by the track. Incoming notes will also be arpeggiated according to any arpeggiator settings \\nmade to the MIDI track. Depending on the CC DIRECT CONNECT  setting, incoming MIDI messages will be \\nhandled differently. For more information about CC DIRECT CONNECT , please see “8.6.4 MIDI SEQUENC -\\nER” on page 37.\\nIf the setting is activated, MIDI CC messages sent to the auto channel or the MIDI channel of the active \\nMIDI track will be sent straight to the MIDI output port. When in LIVE RECORDING mode, specified CCs in \\nthe CTRL 1 and CTRL 2 SETUP pages can be recorded by the sequencer.\\nIf the setting is deactivated, the MIDI tracks listen to MIDI CC messages according to the MIDI MODE MAP -\\nPINGS table found in  “Appendix C: MIDI CONTROL REFERENCE“. Note that MIDI CCs 36-45 sent on the \\nauto channel will be remapped according to the CC messages specified in the CTRL 1 and CTRL 2 SETUP \\npages. The only exception to this is if MIDI CC messages are sent to the MIDI channel of the active track. In \\nthat case, the Octatrack MKII will behave as if CC DIRECT CONNECT  was activated.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",

THE MIDI SEQUENCER\\n9115.3 MIDI MODE RECORDING AND PARAMETER LOCKING\\nWhile in MIDI mode note data and CC values can be recorded in real time to the active MIDI track. Activate \\nLIVE RECORDING mode by pressing [RECORD]  + [PLAY] . For the MIDI track to register incoming MIDI \\ndata, the note or CC data needs to be sent either to the auto channel, which is set in the CHANNELS menu, \\nor to the MIDI channel of the active track. \\nWhen recording note data, chords consisting of up to four notes can be recorded. Note length, velocity and \\naftertouch will be recorded as well. \\nWhen recording CCs using the auto channel, two different scenarios exist. When CC DIRECT CONNECT  is \\nenabled, only CCs which have been specified in the CTRL 1 and CTRL 2 SETUP menus can be recorded. All \\nother MIDI messages will be sent straight to the MIDI OUT port. When CC DIRECT CONNECT  is disabled, \\nCC messages 16-45 can be recorded. Note that CC messages 36–45 are directly linked to the ten avail -\\nable CTRL 1 and CTRL 2 SETUP parameters. Sending for example CC message 36 to the Octatrack MKII \\nwill affect the CC#1 parameter of the CTRL 1 SETUP menu. The CC message will be converted to the CC \\nvalue specified by CC#1 and then sent to the MIDI OUT port. For more information, please see “8.6.4 MIDI \\nSEQUENCER” on page 37.\\nTo add MIDI notes and MIDI parameter locks on the Octatrack MKII sequencer on a per trig basis, press \\n[RECORD]  to activate GRID RECORDING mode. Select the track you want to input data to, keep a [TRIG]  \\nkey pressed and send the note data or CC messages to the auto channel or the MIDI channel of the active \\ntrack. The  CC DIRECT CONNECT  setting will affect the reception of the CCs in the same way as in LIVE \\nRECORDING mode.\\nYou have the possibility to select if note length data should be recorded or not in GRID RE -\\nCORDING MODE using a setting in the PERSONALIZE menu. For more information please \\nsee “8.5.4 PERSONALIZE” on page 33.\\nIf several MIDI tracks have been assigned the same MIDI channel, only the active track will \\nrecord notes or CC data.\\nMessages received on the MIDI channel of the active MIDI track always behave as if CC \\nDIRECT CONNECT is activated.\\nWhen CC DIRECT CONNECT is enabled the Octatrack MKII can record and play back knob \\ntweaks made directly on an external MIDI device. Connect for example a synthesizer, which \\npreferably has been set to local off, to both the MIDI IN and OUT ports of the Octatrack MKII. \\nMake sure the synth knobs send CCs and that those CC messages are sent either to the \\nauto channel or to the MIDI channel of the active track. Also make sure the CC values of the \\nknobs that should be recorded have been set in the CTRL 1/CTRL 2 SETUP menus. The MIDI \\nCC learn functionality, which can be performed in these menus, is a quick way of setting the \\nCCs. When LIVE RECORDING mode is active and a knob, sending a CC value specified in \\none of the CTRL 1/CTRL 2 SETUP menus, is turned on the synthesizer, the knob turn will be \\nrecorded by the Octatrack MKII sequencer. This behavior also applies when setting parame -\\nter locks. Press a [TRIG] key, turn a synth knob that has been specified in one of the CTRL 1/\\nCTRL 2 SETUP menus, and the synth parameter will be locked accordingly.\\nFor a tutorial how the Octatrack MKII can be set up with external MIDI devices when CC \\nDIRECT CONNECT is activated please see “16.5 OCTATRACK MKII AS A MIDI CONTROL \\nCENTER” on page 102.\\n15.4 MIDI TRACK PARAMETER PAGES\\nJust like the audio tracks, each MIDI track contains 5 TRACK PARAMETER pages, each consisting of one \\nMAIN page and one SETUP page. While in MIDI mode the MAIN pages are accessed by simply pressing the \\n[TRACK PARAMETER]  keys. MAIN page parameters are possible to parameter lock and modulate with the \\nMIDI LFOs. Parameters located in the SETUP menus are accessed by either pressing [FUNC]  + [TRACK \\nPARAMETER]  or by quickly double pressing a [TRACK PARAMETER]  key. Setup parameters cannot be \\nparameter locked or affected by the LFOs and usually affect the behavior of the MAIN menu parameters.\\n15.4.1 NOTE MAIN\\nHere the MIDI notes, plus their velocity and length, are set.', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

OCTATRACK MKII SETUP EXAMPLES\\nThe flexibility of the routing of the Octatrack MKII makes it easy to integrate the machine in a lot of various \\nstudio and live setups. Here are a few examples of how it can interact with external audio sources.\\n16.1 OCTATRACK MKII AS A PERFORMANCE HUB\\nA Machinedrum and a Monomachine are MIDI slaved and connected to the two input pairs of the Octa -\\ntrack MKII. The Octatrack MKII acts like a super mixer. It adjusts the levels of the incoming signals, applies \\neffects and samples the other machines in real time. Two main methods setting up the Octatrack MKII exist. \\nIt can either listen to the incoming audio by using the DIR parameters of the MIXER menu or by using Thru \\nmachines.\\n16.1.1 DIR METHOD\\nTo set up the Octatrack MKII for use with the DIR method, follow these instructions.\\n1. Connect the outputs of the Machinedrum and Monomachine to the input pairs of the Octatrack MKII. \\nWe will assume the Machinedrum is being connected to input A/B and the Monomachine to input C/D\\n2. Connect a MIDI cable from MIDI OUT of the Octatrack MKII to MIDI IN of the Machinedrum. Connect \\na MIDI cable from MIDI THRU of the Machinedrum to the MIDI IN of the Monomachine. Make sure \\nthe Machinedrum and Monomachine listen to external MIDI clock and that they respond to external \\ntransport commands.\\n3. Open the PROJECT menu by pressing [PROJ] . Select MIDI and then SYNC. Press [YES] . Enable both \\nTRANSPORT SEND and CLOCK SEND. The Machinedrum and Monomachine will now be slaved to \\nthe BPM and the sequencer transport controls of the Octatrack MKII.  \\n4. Open the MIXER menu by pressing [MIXER] . Make sure DIR for both AB and CD is set to 127. This will \\nroute the incoming sound to the Octatrack MKII main outputs at full volume.

You can sample the incoming audio with track recorders and use the recorder buf -\\nfers to play back the recorded samples.\\nMake sure the MIDI channels assigned to the Octatrack MKII audio tracks aren’t colliding \\nwith the MIDI channels the Machinedrum and Monomachine listen to as this could lead to \\nunintentional trigging of sounds. MIDI channel assignments to the audio tracks are made in \\nthe CHANNELS menu.\\nTurn track 8 into a master track to affect the incoming audio with the master track effects.\\n16.1.2 THRU MACHINES METHOD\\nIn the next example the Thru machines will be used instead of the DIR method. Thru machines offer \\nmore possibilities when it comes to adding effects to the incoming audio, but at the same time each Thru \\nmachine will occupy a track. \\n1.

When [TRACK]  key 1 + [REC1]  are pressed, the track record -\\ner will start recording the guitar. Repeat the procedure for track 2, but set INAB  to B. This will record the \\nbass guitar. Likewise, set up track recorders 3 and 4 so the synth and the vocals can be sampled and \\nprocessed.\\n5. Assign recorder buffer 1 to track 1. Assign recorder buffer 2 to track 2. Do likewise for tracks 3 and 4. \\nNow guitar, bass, synth and vocals can be sampled and immediately played back.\\nYou can now listen to the incoming sounds using a pair of headphones connected to the Octatrack MKII \\nheadphones output. The incoming sounds will not be heard on the main outputs as they are cued. Once you \\nhave sampled the sounds and applied effects, parameter locks etc, they can be played back by the recorder \\nbuffers which are routed to the Octatrack MKII main outputs.

The Octatrack MKII \\nMIDI OUT is connected to the MIDI IN of the synthesizer. A synth module is connected to the MIDI THRU \\nof the synthesizer. The Octatrack MKII can MIDI control both the synthesizer and the synth module. At the \\nsame time the keyboard of the synthesizer can be used to play Octatrack MKII samples, play the synthesiz -\\ner itself as well as the synth module.\\n16.5.1 MIDI CONTROL USING CC DIRECT CONNECT AND THE AUTO CHANNEL\\nBy taking advantage of the CC DIRECT CONNECT feature, easier and more intuitive MIDI sequencing is \\npossible. It allows the Octatrack MKII MIDI sequencer to live record and parameter lock knob CC values \\nof the synthesizer by turning the knobs directly on the synth itself.\\n1. Set the synthesizer so it receives MIDI data on MIDI channel 1. The synth module should listen to MIDI \\nchannel 2. The knobs of the synthesizer should be able to transmit MIDI CCs and the synth keyboard \\nshould be able to transmit MIDI note on/off messages. All synthesizer MIDI messages should be sent \\non channel 16. The synthesizer should be set to local off. The channel assignments can of course be \\nmade differently and are only used in this tutorial as a suggested MIDI setup.\\n2. Open the PROJECT menu by pressing [PROJ] . Select CONTROL and MIDI SEQUENCER. Press \\n[YES] .\\n3. Make sure CC DIRECT CONNECT is activated.  ', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 101}),\n",

Now the \\nactive track, regardless if it is an audio or MIDI track, will always respond to messages sent on this \\nchannel. \\n5. Press [MIDI]  to access the MIDI mode of the Octatrack MKII.\\n6. Select track 1 and either double-tap the [SRC]  key or press [FUNC]  + [SRC]  to open the NOTE SET -\\nUP page. Turn knob A to set CHAN  to 1. Press the knob to confirm the choice. MIDI track 1 now sends \\nout data on MIDI channel 1. This track will control the synthesizer.  \\n7. Repeat the procedure for MIDI track 2, but set the MIDI channel to 2. This track now controls the \\nsynth module.\\n8. Now it is time to set the CC messages that will be possible to record and lock by the Octatrack MKII \\nMIDI sequencer. In this tutorial the filter cutoff parameter of the synthesizer will be set so it is record -\\nable by turning the cutoff knob of the synthesizer directly. Select track 1 and open the CTRL 1 SETUP \\nmenu by either double-tapping [FX1]  or pressing [FUNC]  + [FX1] . \\n9. To avoid having to assign the CC value of the cutoff knob of the synthesizer manually, the MIDI learn \\nfunctionality can be used. Press [FUNC]  + knob C to initiate the MIDI learn function.  \\n10. Turn the cutoff knob of the synthesizer. That CC value will automatically be assigned to the CC1 SET -\\nUP parameter. \\n11. For track 2, the cutoff CC value of the synth module needs to be assigned manually. Open the CTRL \\n1 SETUP menu of track two, look up the CC value for the cutoff knob in the synth module manual and \\nassign this value to the CC1 SETUP  parameter.\\n12. The Octatrack MKII can now sequence the two synths using the MIDI sequencer. When entering LIVE \\nRECORDING mode, selecting track 1 and turning the cutoff knob of the synthesizer, the knob move -\\nments will be recorded by the Octatrack MKII MIDI sequencer. Parameter locks can also be applied \\nin the same way. Press and hold a [TRIG]  key, turn the cutoff knob of the synthesizer and the chosen \\nvalue will be locked to the step. It is of course also possible to sequence the cutoff knob by turning the \\nC knob when the CTRL 1 MAIN page is active. To control the cutoff parameter of the synth module, \\nselect MIDI track 2, make the CTRL 1 page active and turn the C knob.\\nThe keyboard of the synthesizer can now control both the audio tracks of the Octatrack MKII as well as \\nplay melodies on both the synthesizer itself and the synth module. To make the synthesizer play itself, \\nsimply make MIDI track 1 active. Use the keyboard to play the synthesizer module by selecting MIDI track \\n2.

       " Document(page_content='17. OCT A TRACK MKII TUTORIALS\\n10417. OCTATRACK MKII TUTORIALS\\nThe Octatrack MKII is capable of many things. Here a few tutorials highlighting the most prominent features \\nare presented.\\n17.1 TRACK RECORDER SAMPLING\\nWith the Octatrack MKII two main methods of track recorder sampling exist. Manual sampling is performed \\nby manually pressing keys, while recorder trig sampling samples using recorder trigs. Sampling is per -\\nformed by the track recorders, covered in section “9. TRACK RECORDERS AND PICKUP MACHINES” on \\npage 44.\\n17.1.1 MANUAL SAMPLING\\nRecording samples manually with the Octatrack MKII is a straight forward process.\\n1. If you are sampling from the external inputs, make sure audio from an external device is being sent \\nto the Octatrack MKII inputs. The <REC> LEDs indicate the strength of the signal sent to the inputs. \\nIf you hear sound but see no LED activity, try increasing the volume of the external audio by either \\nincreasing the GAIN  parameter in the MIXER menu or by increasing the volume on the external device \\nitself. If you don’t hear any sound, make sure the DIR parameter in the MIXER menu is not set to zero.\\n2. Select the track whose recorder you want to use by pressing the relevant [TRACK]  key.\\n3. If you want to make detailed source settings, open up the RECORDING SETUP 1 menu by pressing \\n[FUNC]  + [REC1] . Select from which source or sources the recorder should sample from by setting \\nINAB , INCD  and SRC3  as needed. If needed, adjust the RLEN  and TRIG  settings. This step is however \\nnot necessary to start sampling.  \\n4. To sample from input A/B, press the [TRACK]  + [REC1]  keys. Depending on the INAB  setting the \\nrecorder will sample from either input A, B, A/B or nothing at all.  \\nTo sample from input C/D, press the [TRACK]  + [REC2]  keys. Depending on the INCD  setting the \\nrecorder will sample from either input C, D, C/D or nothing at all.  \\nTo sample internal sounds, press the [TRACK]  + [REC3]  keys. The recorder will, depending on the \\nSRC3  setting, sample either the main output mix, the cue output mix, an audio track or nothing at all.\\nIn the RECORDING SETUP 2 menu, the FIN and FOUT parameters are found. By setting \\nthese parameters to their lowest values, a very short fade will be applied to the beginning \\nand the end of the sample. This helps to avoid unwanted clicks and pops when the record -\\ned sample loops.\\n17.1.2 SAMPLING USING RECORDER TRIGS\\nThe use of recorder trigs offers a considerably more powerful method of sampling. They offer automated \\nsampling. To use recorder trigs when sampling, please follow these steps.\\n1. If you are sampling from the external inputs, make sure audio from an external device is being sent \\nto the Octatrack MKII inputs. The <REC> LEDs indicate the strength of the signal sent to the inputs. \\nIf you hear sound but see no LED activity, try increasing the volume of the external audio by either \\nincreasing the GAIN  parameter in the MIXER menu or by increasing the volume on the external device \\nitself. If you don’t hear any sound, make sure the DIR parameter in the MIXER menu is not set to zero.\\n2. Select the track whose recorder you want to use by pressing the relevant [TRACK]  key.\\n3. Open up the RECORD SETUP 1 menu by pressing [FUNC]  + [REC1] .\\n4. Select from which source or sources the recorder should sample from by setting INAB , INCD  and \\nSRC3  as needed. If needed, make RLEN  and TRIG  settings.  ', metadata={'source': 'data/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='17. OCT A TRACK MKII TUTORIALS\\n105\\n5. Make sure GRID RECORDING mode is active. If not, press [RECORD]  to activate it. Place out a \\nrecorder trig by pressing a [TRIG]  key. Note that the sequencer while in the RECORD SETUP menus \\nonly reflects recorder trigs.  \\nA recorder trig defaults to sampling from all input sources. When in the RECORDING SETUP 1 menu, \\nthe source a recorder trig samples from can be seen by pressing the [TRIG]  key of the recorder trig. \\nThe activated sources are indicated by inverted graphics in the screen and by lit <REC> leds and \\n[MIDI]  key. Deactivate a recording source by pressing [TRIG]  + [REC1/2/3] .\\n6. Press [PLAY]  to start the playback of the sequencer. Once a record trig has been trigged by the \\nsequencer the track recorder will start to sample.\\nRecorder trigs can be turned into one shot recorder trigs. They trig sampling only once, \\nwhich can be very useful when for example sampling live and not wanting to have to re -\\nmove a recorder trig once it has initiated sampling. One shot recorder trigs are entered by \\npressing [FUNC] + [TRIG] and are indicated by yellow [TRIG] keys. Read more about one \\nshot recorder trigs in section “9.2.2 RECORDER TRIG SAMPLING” on page 48.\\n17.1.3 PLAYBACK OF CAPTURED RECORDER SAMPLES\\nThe samples captured by the track recorders are stored in the recorder buffers located in the Flex sam -\\nple slot list. A sample located in a recorder buffer functions just like a Flex sample.\\n1. To assign a recorder buffer to a track, follow the instructions how to assign a sample to a machine \\ncovered in section “11.3 ASSIGNING FLEX AND STATIC SAMPLES TO MACHINES” on page 56.  \\nThe eight recorder buffers are located above the first Flex sample in the Flex sample slot list. Press \\nthe [UP]  arrow key to access them. \\n2. Any recorder buffer can be assigned to any track. To make it easier to remember the recorder buffer \\ntrack assignments, we suggest to assign the recorder buffer to the track whose track recorder will be \\nused. For example, if the track recorder 1 should be used, assign recorder buffer 1 to track 1.\\n17.1.4 PICKUP MACHINE SAMPLING\\nPickup machine sampling are conducted by using Pickup machines. These machines essentially work as \\nlooper devices, allowing for loop based jamming and experimentation. In this tutorial two Pickup ma -\\nchines will be used to a sample a synth connected to input AB.\\n1. Begin by assigning a Pickup machine to track 1. Double tap the [TRACK 1]  key and select the Pickup \\nmachine option.\\n2. Assign a Pickup machine to track 2 as well.\\n3. Next, set up what - and how - the Pickup machines should sample. Select track 1 and press [FUNC]  + \\n[REC1]  to open RECORDING SETUP MENU 1.\\n4. Set INAB  to A B, INCD  to -, RLEN  to MAX, TRIG  to ONE2, SRC3  to - and LOOP  to ON. By eliminating \\naudio inputs CD and the internal tracks as sampling sources, the risk for accidentally sampling the \\nwrong source is reduced.  \\n5. Press [FUNC]  + [REC2]  to open RECORDING SETUP MENU 2. Set FIN to 0.063 and FOUT  to 0.063. \\nThis will add a very short fade in and out to the loop to be recorded, reducing the risk of experiencing \\nclicks and pops when the sample loops. AB should be set to 127. This will enable direct monitoring \\nof the input pair AB when the Pickup machine is active. QREC  and QPL  should be set to OFF. Press \\n[NO]  to exit the menu.

When \\ndone, press [NO]  to exit.\\n7. Press [SRC]  to open the SRC MAIN menu of the Pickup machine assigned to track 2. Set LEN  to X2. \\nThis Pickup machine will record the slave loop, which now will be twice the length of the master loop. \\nMake sure PTCH  is set to 0, DIR to FWD, GAIN  to 0 and OP to DUB.  \\n8. Press the [TRACK 1]  key to access the SRC MAIN menu of the Pickup machine assigned to track 1. \\nSet PTCH  to 0, DIR to FWD, GAIN  to 0 and OP to DUB. As this Pickup machine will be used to capture \\nthe master loop, the LEN parameter fill no function and can thus be set to any value, preferably to \\nOFF.  \\n9. Play the synth.\\n10. Press [REC1]  to start sampling with the Pickup machine of track 1. Press [REC2]  to stop recording. \\nThe recorded sample will start to loop. Add overdubs by pressing [REC1] , exit overdub mode by press -\\ning [REC2] . If not satisfied with the loop, press [REC2]  while in playback mode to stop the playback. \\nThen initiate sampling again by pressing [REC1] . Once a loop has been recorded, note how the BPM \\nof the Octatrack MKII will change to the BPM of the recorded loop.\\n11. Press [TRACK 2]  to make the Pickup machine of track 2 active. Record a new loop, which automat -\\nically will be twice the length of the original loop, by following the instructions outlined in the step \\nabove.\\nReverse a recorded loop by setting DIR to REV. If DIR is set to PIPO, the loop will play in a \\nping pong fashion.\\nUse a MIDI foot pedal connected to the Octatrack MKII for foot control of the Pickup \\nmachines. See the NOTE MAPPINGS chart, for information about which notes the Pickup \\nmachines respond to. Please see section “APPENDIX C: MIDI CONTROL REFERENCE” on \\npage 137.\\n17.1.5 CONTROLLING THE PICK UP MACHINES WITH A MIDI FOOT CONTROLLER\\nUsing a MIDI foot controller to control the Pickup machines is great when using the Octatrack MKII in a \\nhands-free way. In this tutorial we assume we are going to sample a guitar connected to input A.\\n1. Connect the MIDI OUT of the foot controller to the MIDI IN of the Octatrack MKII.\\n2. Make sure the foot controller sends MIDI messages on the Octatrack MKII auto channel.\\n3. Assign Pickup machines to track 1 and 2. \\n4. Open the RECORDING SETUP 1 menu by selecting track 1 and pressing [FUNC]  + [REC1] .\\n5. Set INAB  to A, INCD  to -, RLEN  to MAX, TRIG  to ONE2, SRC3  to - and LOOP  to ON.

       " Document(page_content='17. OCT A TRACK MKII TUTORIALS\\n107\\n6. Open the RECORDING SETUP 2 menu [FUNC]  + [REC2] . Set FIN to 0.063, FOUT  to 0.063, AB to \\n127, QREC  to OFF, QPL  to OFF and CD to 0.  \\n7. Make the same settings for the Pickup machine on track 2.\\n8. On the foot controller, five pedals are going to be used. Set pedal 1 so it transmits MIDI note 60, a C \\nnote. This will initiate the combo recording, meaning the Pickup machine will sample from both input \\npairs as well as the internal source. As INCD  and SRC3  has both has been set to -, only audio from \\ninput pair AB will be recorded. Pedal 1 thus fills the same function as the [REC1]  key does when con -\\ntrolling the Pickup machine from the Octatrack MKII panel.\\n9. Pedal 2 should transmit MIDI note 64, an E note. This will toggle between Pickup machine play and \\nstop. This pedal fills the same function as the [REC2]  key does when controlling the Pickup machine \\nfrom the Octatrack MKII panel.\\n10. Set pedal 3 so it transmits MIDI note 71, a B note. This will sync the sequencer to the active Pickup \\nmachine and make the sequencer start playing once the synced loop starts over again.\\n11. Set pedal 4 so it transmits MIDI note 69, an A note. This will move the focus of the active track to the \\nprevious track. If for example track 2 is active, pressing this pedal will make track 1 active.\\n12. Set pedal 5 so it transmits MIDI note 68, a G# note. This will move the focus of the active track to the \\nnext track. If for example track 2 is active, pressing this pedal will make track 3 active.\\n13. Make sure track 1 is active. Play the guitar. \\n14. Now you can initate Pickup machine sampling by pressing pedal 1. Press pedal 2 to stop sampling. The \\nrecorded sample will at the same time start looping. Move to track 2 by pressing pedal 5. Move back \\nto track 1 by pressing pedal 4. If you want to sync the Octatrack MKII sequencer to a Pickup machine \\nloop and make it start playing the next time the loop starts over, press pedal 3.\\nMIDI CCs can be used instead of MIDI notes when working with Pickup machines. If the \\nfoot pedal only sends out MIDI CCs, send CC 59 to the autochannel. That CC message will \\nbe interpreted as a note on command by the Octatrack MKII. The CC values correspond to \\nMIDI notes. To initiate for example combo recording, send CC 59 with a value of 60.\\n17.2 LOOP REMIXING\\nRemixing loops is easy and rewarding. The tutorial assumes the set and project found on the bundled \\nCompact Flash card is loaded. See “MOUNTING A SET AND LOADING A PROJECT” on page 17 for more \\ninformation on how to load this set and project.

      "Response : Banks and patterns are related in that each bank contains a set of 16 patterns, which are stored within the bank. When switching between banks, the current pattern is retained, meaning that the sequence of events and the parameters set for that pattern will continue to play back uninterrupted. This allows you to easily experiment with different sounds and settings without halting or cutting off playback.\n",
      "Response : Octatrack MKII is a music performance instrument that gives artists the power to perform live in the truest sense of the word. It's a more robust and improved version of its predecessor, with enhanced features such as durable back-lit buttons, upgraded silky smooth crossfader, ultra crisp OLED screen, precise hi-res encoders, balanced audio inputs, and an improved user interface.\n",
      "Response : A Flex machine is a type of sound manipulation tool used in the Octatrack MKII. It allows users to load samples into the RAM memory of the device and manipulate them through various controls such as PTCH, which adjusts the pitch of the sample. The machine offers extensive sound manipulation possibilities, including twisting, stretching, and reassembling the sample in multiple ways.\n",
      "Response : A trigless trig is a type of trig that can only be applied by converting a sample trig or a lock trig. Unlike a lock trig, which can be edited directly in the sequencer, a trigless trig must be converted from another type of trig before it can be used.\n",
      "Response : Yes, you can use reverb and delay on the same track in a DAW like Logic Pro. In fact, many producers and engineers use these effects together to create interesting soundscapes. To do this, you would need to assign both the reverb and delay effects to the same audio channel, and then adjust their parameters in conjunction with each other.\n",
      "It's worth noting that using both reverb and delay on the same track can create a sense of space and depth, but it's important to use them judiciously and not overdo it, as too much of either effect can become overwhelming and muddy the sound.\n",
